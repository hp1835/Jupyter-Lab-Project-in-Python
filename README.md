News verify with Python

It is the simple python program to detact fake news with the attributes in data set. I used k means to find accurancy of my model. The internet has become essential in our lives, making news more accessible, especially foryoung people who prefer it over traditional media.
In world, where internet access has recently become affordable, many people get their newsonline. However, this rapid spread of information can lead to issues with fake news, which canharm individuals or groups for political, religious, or other purposes.
Research by the BBC on the 2014 Indian general election found significant polarization of fake news on social media, with 72% of Indians unable to distinguish real news from fake.
This project aims to help citizens identify and expose fake news, promoting digital literacy to mitigate its harmful effects.
# Perform various text cleaning steps :
1 Merging Datasets
2 Converting the string into lower case
3 Removing hyper links from news
4 Removing special characters from news
5 Remove stopwords from news
# Conclusion
We learned to detect fake news with Python. We took a political dataset, implemented a TF-IDF Vectorizer, initialized a Cluster analysis, and fit our model. We ended 34 up obtaining an accuracy of 70 in magnitude And we tested the result manually that the news is true or false.
